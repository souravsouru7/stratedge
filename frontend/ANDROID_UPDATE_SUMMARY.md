- `emotionalTags`: Array of strings
- `wouldRetake`: String ("Yes" | "No")

## Capacitor Sync Process

### Steps Completed:
```bash
# 1. Build Next.js app (production build in /out directory)
npm run build

# 2. Sync Capacitor Android project
npx cap sync android

# 3. Open Android Studio
npx cap open android
```ls 'c:\Users\souta\Desktop\new\stratedge\frontend\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\'

### Sync Results:
✅ Web assets copied from `out/` to `android/app/src/main/assets/public`

## Building APK for Testing

### Debug Build (for development):
Open Android Studio and:
1. Go to `Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)`
2. APK will be generated at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Release Build (for production):
1. Update version code/name in `android/app/build.gradle`
2. Ensure signing config is set up
3. Run: `Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK`

## Known Issues & Considerations

### TypeScript Warnings (Non-blocking)
- Some TypeScript warnings in landing page (`app/page.tsx`) about escaped characters
- These don't affect functionality and can be fixed separately
- Build completes successfully despite warnings

### Network Configuration
- App requires internet permission (already configured in AndroidManifest.xml)
- Cleartext traffic allowed for local development (configured in capacitor.config.ts)
- For production, consider enforcing HTTPS only

### Google Authentication
- Google Auth plugin is installed and configured
- Ensure Google Sign-In is working on Android before testing psychology features

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test the Android app on device/emulator using Android Studio
2. **Short-term**: Gather user feedback on psychology tracking UX
3. **Long-term**: Consider adding psychology analytics dashboard for mobile

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
- `frontend/app/indian-market/add-trade/page.js` (+133 lines for psychology UI)
- `frontend/app/upload-trade/page.js` (already had psychology)

### Capacitor/Android:
- `frontend/out/` (Next.js build output - contains new psychology UI)
- `frontend/android/app/src/main/assets/public/` (synced with out/)
- `frontend/capacitor.config.json` (auto-generated during sync)

## Success Criteria

The Android app update is successful when:
- ✅ Psychology section visible on Indian market add-trade page
- ✅ All 4 psychology fields are interactive and functional
- ✅ Psychology data is saved when trade is submitted
- ✅ UI is responsive and touch-friendly on mobile devices
